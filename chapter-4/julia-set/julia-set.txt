Julia Set is the boundary of certain class of functions over complex numbers
For almost all values of the function's parameters, this boundary forms a fractal

Julia Set evaluates a simple iterative equation for points in the complex plane.
A point is not in the set if the process of iterating the equation diverges for that point, that is, if the sequence of values produced by
iterating the equations grows toward infinity, a point is considered outside the set
Conversely, if the values taken by the equation remain bounded, the point is in the set

Z_{n + 1} = Z_n^2 + C
